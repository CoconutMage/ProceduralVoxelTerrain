# ProceduralVoxelTerrain
 Modular scripts that are easy to use for implementing procedural voxel terrain in unity

I have since gone to improve upon this system in another project by adding the ability to generate smooth, non-voxel terrain, as well as generating features like realistic looking mountains, and procedural trees to populate an infinitely explorable world using render distance, with plans to eventually try and simulate erosion on a large scale for river generation.

Inside the ProceduralTerrain folder you'll find the scripts that make up the basic system seen in the included tech demo.

I have also included some of the code I built onto this system in the testing folder for more complex terrain generation, though you may find that its not as neat as much of it is in progress and partially designed out in paper notebooks.

.rar file contains a tech demo to see scripts in action.
